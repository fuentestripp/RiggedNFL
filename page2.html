        <h3>Example 1: The 2020 AFC Championship</h3>

        <p>Let's start at our most recent example of blantant rigging: the 2019 AFC Championship.</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSY90Z5ears" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>The referee calls a flag before any action by either team is taken, and despite the fact that the Titans did not get the first down, it did not change the fact that the referees attempted to ensure that the Chiefs had enough of an advantage to win. Of course, there are more examples in this game, such as a terrible pass interference call by referees that ensured a Chiefs victory at the end of the game, but this was just one example.</p>

        <h3>Example 2: The 2013 NFC Championship. As a native San Franciscan this one hurts.</h3>

        <p> One could claim bias because these were my heros growing up as well as the idols of all my friends in middle school, and to see a trophy taken from them unjustly is heartbreaking as a child, but one cannot deny the unbelievably questionable calls in the 2013 Champtionship game between San Francisco and Seattle.</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylbzC6YNZeQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>While I apologize for the terrible quality the big thing I would like to point out in this video is how blantantly the referees take away any momentum as well as disregard actual broken bones and career-ending injuries (As we see with Narvarro Bowman) to ensure that Seattle goes to the Super Bowl and not San Francisco.</p>

        <h3> Example 3: The Patriots </h3>

        <p>If you like football, you do not like the Patriots. It's really as simple as that. While I potentially delve into a conspiracy theory belief, I would like to first say that nobody in the NFL gets to where they are without a certain amount of skill. Bill Belichick is the smartest football coach in the history of football. I am not taking anything away from that.</p>
        <p> Actually, I am. You can attribute all of Brady and Belichick's success to one blatantly rigged play, that was motivated due to the 9/11 attacks in 2001.</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8gtOAyPWwE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>For those who understand football, they understand that there is no justification for this call. Being as objective as possible, it is a fumble. No questions asked. However, after the attacks in 2001, there was an increasing amount of nationalism and pride in being an American, and it was only fitting that during that season the Patriots should be the best team in the league.</p>

        <h3>Example 4: The Saints.</h3>
        <p>After the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2006 the nation needed a feel good story for New Orleans to not feel entirely bad for the terrible condition it was left in (No aid from George Bush). That feel good story was the Super Bowl.</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRd5jkJ1dEo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>I have nothing further to say.</p>

        <h3> Example 5: Kaepernick </h3>
        <p>There is potential that I'm biased, because I grew up watching Colin Kaepernick, and for 2 years he was the face of our city, but despite his fantastic ability on the field, the NFL "blackballed" Kaepernick and didn't allow him on any NFL team to appease to their sensitive viewers.</p>
        <p>As a result, league higher-ups also sent the Patriots to the Super Bowl for 3 years in a row.</p>
